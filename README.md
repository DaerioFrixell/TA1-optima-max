This app created with next stack:
- React 18
- TypeScript 4.9
- Redux Toolkit
- SCSS 7

Library in that app: 
- React-Router-Dom 6
- Axios
- Redux-Saga

Also, I make some tests with "testing-library-react"

There are some page in this app:
- The first page with info about imaginary company.
- The second page with products list. That page has functions "to add" product in cart, "increment and decrement" count of selected product and "remove" selected product.
- The third page is "cart".  That page has functions "increment/decrement" count of selected product, remove product from cart and clear cart.

If you wanna run this app local you need to make next steps:
1. To make git clone, then "npm i", (if you use npm, but not yarn)
2. Run app: "npm start" 
3. Run test: "npm run test"
